## Planning phase

### **1. Requirements Analysis**
- **Objectives:** Define the cameraâ€™s main functions (e.g., motion detection, night vision, temperature monitoring).  
- **Technical Specifications:** Camera resolution, sensors, power consumption, storage capacity, etc.  
- **Environmental Conditions:** Weather resistance, operating temperature range, battery life.  

---

### **2. Hardware Selection**  
- **Processor:** The STM32MP257FAK3 is already considered; check its compatibility with required components.  
- **Sensors:** Motion detectors (PIR), ambient light sensors, ultrasonic microphones.  
- **Storage:** MicroSD card or internal flash memory.  
- **Communication:** Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or LTE for data transmission.  
- **Power Supply:** Battery, solar panel, or external power source.  

---

### **3. Software Architecture**  
- **Operating System:** Linux-based distribution (e.g., Yocto or Buildroot).  
- **Firmware:** Real-time software for sensor control.  
- **Middleware:** Data processing, image and audio capturing, sensor management.  
- **Application:** User interface (web or app-based).  

---

### **4. Development & Prototyping**  
- **Prototyping Board:** Use development boards featuring the STM32MP257FAK3.  
- **Modularity:** Develop and test hardware and software components separately.  

---

### **5. Testing & Validation**  
- **Field Tests:** Test in real-world outdoor environments.  
- **Research Suitability:** Ensure data accuracy and long-term reliability.  

---

### **6. Production & Deployment**  
- Consider small-batch production or DIY kits for deployment.
